## Project of algorithms and principles of computer science
### This is a project that is part of my bachelor's degree course on algorithms and principles of computer science. The project consisted in creating a C program to emulate a game similar to "wordle" but passing speed and memory tests. The aim of the project was to use data structures and complexity analyzes to make the code as fast as possible and with the lowest possible memory usage. Within the code it is therefore possible to find trees and lists and effective memory management. The project was evaluated with a score of 30/30 with honors.
